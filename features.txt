Overview:
Write an application that shows your front end and overall development capabilities to build a mini-application for Uber users.
It will allow a user to login by authenticating their Uber account with the application,
and show them their ride history in Table format and also an option to see it on a Map view of everywhere they have used Uber.

Features:
Use the Uber API to auth the user and log them in
Save the user information in the DB for the user account once auth’d, or create the entry if its the first auth
Pull the ride history from the API and save it to the DB
Allow for a Sync feature that will pull updated ride history from the API (you can choose where/when such as on login or a sync button or whatever you prefer)
Show the user’s ride history in a map view for the cities they have used Uber in and a table view as well
